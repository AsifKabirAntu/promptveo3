#### **Clothing & Accessories**
- Complete outfit descriptions with specific colors and styles
- Accessories matched to personality and style
- Professional, casual, trendy, minimalist, or creative looks

#### **Example Character Description**
```
28-35-year-old female with oval face shape, large blue eyes with long eyelashes, 
straight nose, full lips, soft jawline, naturally straight to wavy brown hair 
styled in loose waves ending just below shoulders, fair skin with warm undertones, 
average height with healthy average build, wearing a soft heather gray fitted 
t-shirt with medium-wash slim-fit jeans and clean white canvas sneakers, small 
hoop earrings and a simple crossbody bag in tan leather. Maintains consistent 
appearance and confident enthusiastic demeanor throughout all scenes.
```

### **Product Consistency System**
Generates **detailed product specifications** from analysis data:

#### **Physical Specifications**
- Exact color descriptions from dominant color analysis
- Material construction details
- Size and dimension specifications
- Condition and wear markers

#### **Brand & Feature Details**

```

dimensions, pristine condition, featuring advanced camera system, Action Button, 
titanium build, with consistent branding and labeling visible, maintains exact 
same appearance and positioning throughout all scenes.
```

### **Environment Variation Strategy**
While **character and product remain identical**, environments change contextually:

- **Scene 1**: Minimalist studio for product introduction
- **Scene 2**: Cozy home kitchen for daily use demonstration  
- **Scene 3**: Outdoor park setting for lifestyle integration

This approach provides **visual variety** while maintaining **consistency** where it matters most.
